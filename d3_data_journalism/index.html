					<h2>Correlations Discovered Between Age, Poverty and Healthcare Access</h2>
					<p> From this analysis we can see that Mississippi (MS- 21.5%) has the highest percent of their
						population in poverty. They are closely followed by New Mexico (NM- 21.3%). While these
						populations display higher than average poverty, they do preform at or near the average for
						Percent of Population with
						Access to Healthcare. Thus, the population in poverty can benefit from healthcare services.
						Texas (TX) has the highest Percent of Population with Access to Healthcare and a percent of
						poverty that is slightly higher than average.</p>

					<p> States like Massaachusettes (MA) and Vermont (VT) display lower than average Percent of
						Population in Poverty, with 11.6% and 12.2% of their populations in poverty. However, they also
						indicate having the lowest values for % of Population with Access to Healthcare. </p>

					<p> The Average Age of most states clusters between 35 years old and 40 years of age. Again,
						Massachusettes (MA) and Vermont (VT) display lowest access to health care for their population.
						They have an average age of 39 and 43. Utah (UT) has the youngest population and slightly above
						average access to health care. Maine (ME) displays the oldest average age, at 44 years old, with
						average access to healthcare services</p>
